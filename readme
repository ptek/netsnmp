NOTE: due to limited amount of time, this code is not very well maintained
Consider using the snmp package instead:
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/snmp

The (Haskell) NetSNMP package is a binding for a subset of the libsnmp
api provided by the NetSNMP project.  It is initially being developed
against NetSNMP version 5.4.1, but probably works with most or all 5.*
versions.

Currently supported protocol versions:
  SNMPv1  -- original SNMP
  SNMPv2c -- v2 protocol with old community-based security

Not yet supported:
  SNMPv3  -- v2 protocol plus new v3 party-based security

Other versions are not supported by the underlying library, and are
unlikely to ever be supported by this package.
  SNMPsec -- first attempt to add strong security to SNMPv1
  SNMPv2p -- initial SNMPv2, with v2 party-based security
  SNMPv2u -- v2 protocol with user-based security
  SNMPv2* -- proprietary hybrid variant of v2c and v2p

This binding requires that net-snmp be built without
NETSNMP_DISABLE_SNMPV1 or NETSNMP_DISABLE_SNMPV2C.  I'd love to
support those options, since they may encourage better security, but I
won't be able to prioritize this in the forseeable future.

A word about stability: we have taken over the maintenance of the
library back when we needed a way to collect SNMP Data at Global
Access Internet Services GmbH. We use it in production ourselves but I
would not be as corageous as to claim it to be stable for
everyone. Hopefully it is useful to someone though.
