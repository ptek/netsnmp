0.3.2.1 - 11. April 2016
        * Fix parsing IPs. Issue #4 (https://github.com/ptek/netsnmp/issues/4)
	  In the prevois code, "0.0.0.0" converts to "\NUL.\NUL.\NUL.\NUL"
	  Thanks to lievenm (https://github.com/lievenm) for pointing it out.
	* Remove the dependency on utf8-string. Using ByteString.Char8 instead
	  since the oids we were decoding as utf8 before, are number after all
	  and should not be in UTF8 range anyway

0.3.2.0 - 19. June 2015
        * Make the library compile with GHC 7.10.1

0.3.1.0 - 19. April 2014
        * Make the library work on Debian 7 with ByteString 0.9

0.3.0.6
        * OIDpart type is hacked to work correctly on OS X

0.3.0.5
        * Tied the OIDPart to the correct C Type of the oid.
          NOTE: This breaks the code on the OS X and we don't know why
                The oid of the SNMP Result can not be read correctly

0.3.0.4
        * Reduced the default number of max-repetitions in Bulk PDUs to 30.
          The previous value caused oversized responses on Extreme Network
          switches.

0.3.0.3
        * Fixed a bug, where instead of 32 bit, the OID part was set to CLong,
          which became 64 bit in base 4.5

0.3.*
        * Switch from Strings to ByteStrings

0.2.*
        * Implementation includes snmpBulkWalk
